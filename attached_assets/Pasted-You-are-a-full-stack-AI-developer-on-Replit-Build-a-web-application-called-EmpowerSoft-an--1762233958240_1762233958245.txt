You are a full-stack AI developer on Replit.  
Build a web application called **EmpowerSoft** — an MVP of a SaaS platform for on-demand software access.  
Use **React (Vite)** for the frontend and **Node.js with Express** for the backend API.  
Style everything using **TailwindCSS** with a **liquid glass (frosted glass / glassmorphism)** design.

## 🔷 PROJECT OVERVIEW

EmpowerSoft is a platform that allows users to browse, purchase, and manage access to software apps by category — Mechanical, Visual Media, and IT Tools.  
Each app can be launched, paused, resumed, or deleted, and users pre-pay for a number of active hours.

## 🧠 PAGES / ROUTES

### 1. Landing Page (`/`)
- Modern hero section with glass-like cards.
- Show EmpowerSoft logo, slogan, and a short company description.
- Include “Login” and “Sign Up” buttons that route to `/login` and `/signup`.
- Add soft animation background (blur + gradient).

### 2. Login & Signup (`/login`, `/signup`)
- Simple frosted glass card for form.
- Mock authentication (store user info locally using browser localStorage).
- On successful login, redirect to `/dashboard`.

### 3. Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- Glassmorphic dashboard showing list of user’s purchased apps.
- Columns: App Name, Status (Running/Paused), Remaining Hours, Retention Days, Cost, Actions.
- Action buttons:
  - ▶ Launch → opens `/workspace`
  - ⏸ Pause / Resume → toggles app state
  - ❌ Delete → shows confirmation modal before deletion
- Mock data for now (hardcode some purchased apps).
- Floating “+ Get New App” button → routes to `/catalog`.

### 4. App Catalog (`/catalog`)
- Show cards grouped by categories:
  - 🧩 Mechanical (Creo, SolidWorks)
  - 🎬 Visual Media (Premiere Pro, Blender)
  - 💻 IT Tools (Jupyter Notebook, Database Monitor)
- Each card shows:
  - App name + small image/icon
  - Dropdown for “CPU/Memory Tier” (Low, Medium, High)
  - Input for “Active Hours”
  - “Get App” button → Mock purchase, add to dashboard list.

### 5. Workspace (`/workspace`)
- When user launches an app, this page opens.
- Show an iframe or placeholder canvas that says:
  “Workspace Active: [App Name]”
- Add “Pause” and “Terminate” buttons.
- Terminate brings back to Dashboard.

### 6. Help & Docs (`/help`)
- Glassmorphic cards listing:
  - FAQs
  - Contact Support (mock email form)
  - Documentation link placeholders.

## 🎨 STYLE REQUIREMENTS

- Use **glassmorphism / liquid glass design**:
  - Transparent backgrounds with blur (e.g. `bg-white/10 backdrop-blur-lg`).
  - Soft gradients (`from-cyan-500/30 to-purple-500/20`).
  - Neon/glow hover effects.
  - Rounded corners and subtle shadows.
- Responsive layout (desktop + mobile).
- TailwindCSS config should include custom colors for EmpowerSoft brand (cyan, blue, purple).
- Use an elegant font (e.g. “Poppins” or “Inter”).

---

## ⚙️ BACKEND

- Create `/api/apps` route:
  - GET → list of mock apps
  - POST → add new purchased app (store temporarily in memory or file)
- Use Express with CORS enabled.
- Later can connect to a database (for now use mock JSON).

---

## 🔐 FUNCTIONALITY (MVP)

- Mock authentication using localStorage.
- Mock app state management (Running/Paused/Terminated).
- LocalStorage retains user apps and their remaining hours.
- Simple state timer logic for active hours (countdown simulation).
- Each app has:
  - Name
  - Category
  - Tier (Low/Medium/High)
  - Hours purchased
  - Hours remaining
  - Retention days (static for now)
  - Status

---

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT (Replit MVP)

- Run backend on port 5000 and frontend on 5173 (Vite default).
- Use concurrently to run both with a single `npm run dev`.
- Add `"proxy": "http://localhost:5000"` in frontend `package.json`.
- Final layout:
